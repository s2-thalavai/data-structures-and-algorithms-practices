## Compile the Java source file

    Open a terminal or command prompt.

    Navigate to the directory where you saved the .java file using the cd command. 

    Use the javac command followed by the name of your .java file to compile the code. For example:

        javac MyProgram.java

This command will create a .class file (e.g., MyProgram.class) containing the bytecode.

## Run the Java program

In the same terminal or command prompt, use the java command followed by the name of the class file (without the .class extension) to run the program. 

For example:

    java MyProgram
